The purpose of this project was to perform sentiment analysis on review dataset provided by Yelp. 
The data was preprocessed using opinion lexicon, stopword elimination and Tf-idf vectorization. 
Feature vector was created using preprocessed review text, user and business data given by yelp. 
Then the feature vector was used by create model using logestic regression, kNN with 25 neighbours 
and random forest classifiers with 250 trees. Out of these three classifiers logistic classifiers 
and random forest performance was very close and slightly better than kNN.
